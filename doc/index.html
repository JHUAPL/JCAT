<body>

<p>
  The Java CRISM Analysis Tool (JCAT) can be used to view CRISM data
  downloaded from the Planetary Data System
  (PDS) <a href="https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/">Geosciences Node</a>
  at <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University</a> in
  St. Louis.
<p>
  JCAT requires Java version 8 or later to run, along with Java FX.
  The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Java
  SE Runtime Environment 8</a> (JRE) from Oracle includes both.
<p>
  JCAT is distributed as a jar file.  Version 1.0 was released on Nov
  1, 2019.  Double click the jar file, or from the command line, type
  <pre>
    java -jar JCAT.jar
    </pre>
<p>
  Follow the <a href="JCAT_Tutorial.pdf">JCAT Tutorial</a> to get
  started.
